# Template-Finder

I completed this project using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Pug, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

This website offers templates for well-known algorithms and data structures as well as follow-up tasks for future applications. 
Node.js was chosen because of its lightweight nature, ability to handle multiple parallel requests, & faster code execution. 
The website is now LIVE and anyone can contribute to it.
